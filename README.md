# Project 1
## Modeling Bobcat Populations

We model bobcat populations under a variety of conditions and assumptions. Three different annual growth rates depending on local environmental conditions: `r = 0.01676`, `r = 0.00549`, and `r = -0.04500`.

### 1. Basic Growth
Assuming an initial population of 100 bobcats, we model the short-term (10 year) and long-term (25-30 year) bobcat population under the three conditional rates.

### 2. Hunting (Best Condition `r = 0.01676`)
When conditions allow for a growing population, we allow for hunting. Model how hunting impact the population under a variety of fixed amount and fixed percentage rates.

### 3. Hunting Strategy
Devise a strategy that allows the bobcat population to increase to about 200 bobcats, then remains constant over time.

### 4. Introduction (Worst Condition `r = -0.04500`)
Model short and long term implications of a variety of fixed amount and fixed percentage introduction rates.

### 5. Introduction
Devise a strategy for introduction to stablize the population at both 200 bobcats and 50 bobcats.
